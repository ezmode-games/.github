# Code of Conduct

Don't be a dick.

## Why This Matters

In 1982, SMTP was designed with zero authentication. No passwords. No verification. Anyone could send email as anyone.

This worked for years. Engineers trusted each other. The network was small. People were not dicks.

Then in 1978, Gary Thuerk sent the first spam - an ad for DEC computers to 400 ARPANET users. People complained, but it was an isolated incident. The community self-corrected.

For over a decade, good faith held. SMTP remained open. Email worked.

Then the web happened. Money happened. In 1994, lawyers Canter and Siegel blasted immigration services ads to thousands of newsgroups. They made money. Others noticed.

By 2000, spam was 8% of email. By 2010, it was 90%.

Because a few people decided to be dicks, we now have SPF, DKIM, DMARC, reputation scoring, spam filters, CAPTCHAs, rate limiting, and email deliverability as an entire industry. Billions of dollars spent. Billions of hours wasted. All because good faith failed.

## The Point

Open source communities work like early SMTP. We trust each other. We help each other. We assume good intent.

This only works if you're not a dick.

One bad actor can poison a community. One troll can drive away contributors. One harasser can end a project.

So we have one rule: **Don't be a dick.**

If you're unsure whether something is being a dick, it probably is.

## What Happens If You're a Dick

You get one warning. Then you're out.

We don't have time for drama. We're here to build tools for modders.
