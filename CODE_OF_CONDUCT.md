# Code of Conduct

Don't be a dick.

## Why This Matters

In 1971, email started on ARPANET. No passwords. No verification. Anyone could send anything to anyone. It was a closed network of researchers and military - maybe 2,600 users total. People were not dicks, so it worked.

On May 3, 1978, Gary Thuerk at DEC sent the first spam - an ad for their new computers to 393 West Coast ARPANET users. It generated $13 million in sales. The community was furious. A military officer called it "a flagrant violation." Thuerk promised not to do it again.

In 1982, SMTP was formalized (RFC 821). Still no authentication. Still trusted everyone. The network was growing but the culture held.

Then the web happened. Money happened.

On April 12, 1994, immigration lawyers Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel blasted "Green Card Lottery" ads to 5,500 Usenet groups in 90 minutes using a Perl script. Their ISP's servers crashed from complaint emails. They made $100,000 and wrote a book about it. Canter was eventually disbarred.

But others noticed it worked.

By 2000, spam was 8% of email. By 2010, over 90%.

Because people decided to be dicks, we now have SPF, DKIM, DMARC, reputation scoring, spam filters, CAPTCHAs, rate limiting, and email deliverability as an entire industry. Billions of dollars spent. Billions of hours wasted. All because good faith failed.

## The Point

Open source communities work like early ARPANET. We trust each other. We help each other. We assume good intent.

This only works if you're not a dick.

One bad actor can poison a community. One troll can drive away contributors. One harasser can end a project.

So we have one rule: **Don't be a dick.**

If you're unsure whether something is being a dick, it probably is.

## What Happens If You're a Dick

You get one warning. Then you're out.

We don't have time for drama. We're here to build tools for modders.
