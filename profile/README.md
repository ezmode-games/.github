# ezmode games

We build tools for modders.

## What We're Building

**[CTD - Crash Reporter](https://github.com/ezmode-games/ctd)**

When your game crashes, CTD captures the context - stack trace, load order, game version - and makes it easy to share with mod creators.

Open source. Self-hostable. Free.

**[ferritest](https://github.com/ezmode-games/ferritest)**

Multi-threaded memory stress testing tool written in Rust. 8 test patterns, real-time progress, zero unsafe code.
